 ## Design Process

As the designer/planner/coder of Kobuy, I decided to go with a more simple and minimalist style to bring comfort to the eyes of the user
This is where I used a template to give me an idea on how I should plan out my website format
As a designer, I had to design the aesthetics of the website to make it look good and pleasing to the eyes
This is where I decided to use a bright orange theme style aesthetic as it is pleasing to look at and it cleanly mixes with white as well.
I decided to put commonly accessed links at the top of the page for convenience, such as contact links, point leaderboards, account, wishlist and cart.
Below the header, i put categories that the user may be interested in, so that they can easily be accessed by customers
On the homepage, adverts for products are placed first, such that advertisers can be certain that their advertisements will be seen by consumers when they first access the site
I then added a section for products to be listed. Products have a common format such that new products can be easily added on any pages
Each category page contains a filter section on the left such that users can precisely select what products they wish to view
There are 3 tabs in each product page, the description, details, and reviews.
- Description allows sellers to explain their product to their audience
- Details allows sellers to state the product specifications
- Reviews allows users to post their reviews about the product
